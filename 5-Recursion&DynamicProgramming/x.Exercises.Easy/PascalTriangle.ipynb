    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "Pascal Triangle is an infinite triangular array such that each item is the sum of the upper-left and upper-right items in the array.\n",
    "The item with no items above it (at row=0) is simply 1. Each row is to have 1 more item that the row above it. Create a function that generates a pascal triangle of N rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "   1 1\n",

    "## Recursive Solution\n",
    "We can break down the problem into two problems: generating the rows then printing all the rows as a triangle. We will create two function `pascalRow` and `pascalTriangle` to handle those problems respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implement `pascalRow` with a recursive algorithm as follows...\n",
    "* 2 Base cases \n",
    "    * row < 0: invalid input, return empty list\n",
    "    * row=0: return [1]\n",
    "* Recursive case: row > 1\n",
    "* Recursive call: pascalRow(row-1) -> get last row and use it to construct current row\n",
    "* Recurrence Relation: $F^{r}_{i} = F^{r-1}_{i} + F^{r-1}_{i-1}$ \n",
    "    * $F^{r}_{i}$ is the value at index i of row r in the pascal triangle\n",
    "    * this recurrence relation follows similar pattern to the Fibonacci Sequence\n",
    "    * we use this recurrence relation to construct the solution from the subsolutions to the subproblems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "* Time Complexity: $O(N^2)$\n",
    "    * `pascalRow` is $O(N^2)$\n",
    "        * only 1 recursive call in each layer of stack, so the stack is size O(N)\n",
    "        * in each layer of the stack, we have a for loop up to N which is O(N)\n",
    "        * $T(N) = N * N = O(N^2)$  \n",
    "    * `pascalTriangle` is $O(N^3)$\n",
    "        * the for loop means we end up doing an arithmetic sum of squares of number up to N\n",
    "        * $T(N) = 1^2 + 2^2 +...+N^2$\n",
    "        * Arithmetic sum of squares equation: $S_n = \\frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$\n",
    "            * a = 1st term in sequence\n",
    "            * $a_n$ = last term in sequence\n",
    "        * The arithmetic sum of squares equation is $O(N^3)$\n",
    "* Space Complexity: $O(N^2)$\n",
    "    * `pascalRow` is $O(N^2)$: stack length N, each layer creates a new row up to N length\n",
    "        * T(n) = N*N = $O(N^2)$\n",
    "    * We don't really have to worry about the for loop in `pascalTriangle` adding to space complexity because the stack stops existing once the function returns the final solution. So we'll create a new stack N times, but they won't exist at the same time.\n"
