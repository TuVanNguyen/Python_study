    "## Greedy Parralel Two Pointer Approach\n",
    "In order to optimize the number of children we satisfy, we should try to assign to each child the smallest size cookie they'd accept. This makes this problem a candidate for a greedy algorithm. To implement, we should sort both the greed factor and the cookie size arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we can use parralel two pointers to iterate through both arrays. We will start with the least greedy child and the smallest cookie at the beginning of the arrays. If the child accepts the cookie, we move on to the next child and next size cookie. If not, we'll just move onto the next size cookie. We stop the iteration when we run out of kids or cookies.\n",

    "    * sorting the cookies is T(N) = NlogN\n",
    "    * iterating through the arrays is min(N,M), but we can ignore since it's a smaller factor than sorting either array\n",
    "    * T(n) = MlogM + NlogN = O(MlogM + NlogN)\n",
    "* Space Complexity: O(M+N)\n",
    "    * we need to create new arrays for the sorted children and cookies"
