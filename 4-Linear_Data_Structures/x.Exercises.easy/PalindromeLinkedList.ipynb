If we traversed the entire list without returning False, return True.\n",

    "## Multiple Two Pointers Approach: Fast&Slow, Forward, and Collision\n",
    "We can break up this problem into 3 problems that can be solved using Two Pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we do so, we need to consider the base case `head == None`. If true, return True since we consider empty list a palindrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, set result to True.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem is breaking up the list in half, so that we can compare the left side and right side. We can do this by finding the midpoint. To efficiently find the midpoint in a linked list, we can use the Fast and Slow Two Pointers Approach. See the [Middle of the Linked List Problem](x.Exercises.easy/LinkedListMidpoint.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "The second problem is reversing the right half of the list, so that we can compare it to the left half. If the list is a palindrome, the reverse of the right half should be the same as the left half. We can reverse linked lists using the Forward Two Pointers Approach. See the [\"Reverse Linked List\" Problem](x.Exercises.easy/ReverseLinkedList.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "The third problem is comparing the two halves of the list. This can be done with a simple Collision Two Pointer Approach. Start `left` pointer at the head of the original list, and the `right` pointer at the head of the reversed right side list. For each iteration, we compare the values. If the values are not equal, store result as False. Otherwise, advance both `left` and `right` pointers to the next node. We do this until they meet at the midpoint. See the [Palindrome Problem](x.Exercises.easy/Palindrome.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we need to reverse the right side of the linked list again. This restores the linked list to what it is originally and is good practice for algorithms. Finally, we return the result\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "* Time Complexity: O(N)\n",
    "    * Finding the midpoint is T(N) = N/2\n",
    "    * Reversing half the list is T(N) = N/2\n",
    "    * Comparing the two halves of the lists to each other is again T(N) = N/2\n",
    "    * Reversing half of the list again is T(N) = N/2\n",
    "    * In sum, doing all these operations together is T(N) = 4 * N/2 = 2N = O(N)\n",
    "* Space Complexity: O(1):\n",
    "    * we end up switching elements in the original list rather than creating another data structure to manipulate. This means no extra space was needed to solve this problem.\n"
