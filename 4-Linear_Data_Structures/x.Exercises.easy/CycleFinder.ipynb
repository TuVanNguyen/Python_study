The fast runner will end up at the same spot as the slow runner eventually no matter the size of the cycle. That's because after the fast runner completes a loop in the cycle with slow runner in it, the fast runner has a gap X behind the slow runner. With each iteration, the gap decrements by 1 until eventually the fast runner ends up in the same spot as the slow runner.\n",
