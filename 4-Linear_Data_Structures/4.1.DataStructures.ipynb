    "* A collection where once an item is added, the item stays in that position relative to other elements that came before or after it\n",
    "* includes stacks, queues, deques, and lists \n",
    "* has two ends where (depending on the type of linear structure), an item can be added or removed\n",

    "### Why know these linear structures?\n",
    "* some of the most useful data structures in computer science because they're used in many algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.3 The Stack\n",
    "* adding and subtracting items always takes place at the same end known as the \"top\"\n",
    "* the other end is \"the base\"\n",
    "* Ordering principle: LIFO (last-in first-out)\n",
    "* Important property: removal is reverse order of insertion\n",
    "    * One use is using the \"back\" button on web browsers to go to the last page visited: the button retrieves pages in reverse order to when you visited them\n",
    "* See [Stack.py](Stack.py) for full implementation of a stack\n",

    "## 4.19 Lists (i.e Array)\n",
    "* an collection where each item has a position relative to the others\n",
    "* each item has an index\n",
