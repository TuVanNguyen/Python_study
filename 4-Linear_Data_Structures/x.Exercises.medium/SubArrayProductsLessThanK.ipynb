    "## Brute Force Approach\n",

    "## Sliding Window Approach\n",
    "We can improve the above brute force approach if we avoid recomputing the products for some of the overlapping subarrays. We can do that by use the sliding window approach. We'll need two pointers: `left` and `right`. We start the `left` pointer at index 0 of `nums`. We'll implement the right pointer in a for loop over the array `nums`.  For each number in `nums`, we want to find the sliding window such that the product of everything inside is under k. We have a `prefix_product` variable that keeps track of the cumulative product. If `prefix_product >= k`, we need to move the `left` pointer towards `right` until `prefix_product < k`. Then, we need to add to `count` all the subarrays that make up the sliding window. That will simply be `subarrays = right - left + 1`.\n",
