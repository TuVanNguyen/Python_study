# 1. Introduction

## 1.3 What is Computer Science?
  * the study of problems, problem solving, and solutions from the problem solving process
  * a study of algorithms
    * def **algorithm**: n.finite processes that if followed will solve a problem
  * the study of problems that are and that are not computable 
    * def **computable**: adj. having an existing algorithm that can solve it [a problem]
  * the study of **abstraction** of problems and algorithms
    * e.g user interfaces, the use of libraries to reuse solutions without knowing all the details

## 1.4 What is Programming?
  * writing an algorithm into a programming language, to be executed by a computer
  * creating the representation on our solutions

## 1.5 Why Study Data Structures and Abstract Data Types
  * Help simplify problems and problem-solving process, to effectively understand and manipulate them
  *  **abstract data type**: logical description of data members and operations disregarding implementation
  * **data structure**: the implementation of an abstract data type

## 1.6 Why Study Algorithms
  * algorithms can act as a set of techniques for solving known problems, to help us solve new problems
  * develop better pattern recognition so better understand how to solve the next problem
  * to be able to compare algorithms and figure out the better or best solution
  * to distinguish solvable from unsolvable problems
