    "* also a divide and conquer technique similar to merge sort\n",
    "* doesn't use additional storage because instead of splitting lists, we'll be using pivot points\n",
    "* The pivot point will start at pivot=0 for list `alist` of length n\n",
    "* we have a leftmark that starts at i_left=i+1, and rightmark that starts at i_right=n-1\n",
    "* i_left increases until alist[i_left] > alist[pivot], and i_right decreases until  alist[i_right] < alist[pivot] \n",
    "    * when both are true, switch alist[i_left] and alist[i_right]\n",
    "* keep going until i_right < i_left. At that point i_right is the split point.\n",
    "* if alist[pivot] > alist[i_right], switch them (when i_right=split_point)\n",
    "* two sublists are created: alist[:i_right], alist(i_right:)\n",
    "    * alist[:i_right] contains all values less than alist[pivot]\n",
    "    * alist[i_left:] contains all values greater than alist[pivot]\n",
    "* then you recursively call quickSort on the two sublists\n",
    "    * base case: start <= end, return alist without sorting\n",
    "        * applies when list has 1 or less items\n",
    "        * also applies when a sublist we're quicksorting has 1 or less items (end recursive call)\n",
    "    * recursive case: when the sublists after 1 round of quicksort has length greater than 1\n",
    "    * recursive call:\n",

    "        * if the partition is always in the middle, the list gets roughly divided in half on each pass\n",
    "        * so the recursion stack is $log_2(n)$ deep\n",
    "        * and on each layer, you make n comparisons\n",
    "        * so O(n*log(n))\n",
    "    * Worst case: $O(n^2)$\n",
    "        * the partition gets split towards the end or beginning of the list i.e in sorted or reverse sorted arrays\n",
    "        * so the recursion stach is more-or-less n deep\n",

    "        * each time we call quickSort recursively, we are dividing the list at the pivot point\n",
    "        * assuming that on average the list and sublists will be divided roughly in half, that means the recursion depth is O(logn)\n",
