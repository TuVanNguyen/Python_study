    "* Instead of using searching algorithms that are O(n) or O(log(n)), we can store data in a data structure that can be searched in O(1)\n",
    "* This data structure is a **hash table**\n",
    "* a **hash function** maps items to a specific **slot** in the hash table\n",
    "    * **perfect hash functions** maps all items to a unique slot\n",

    "* Unfortunately, there's no systematic way to construct a perfect hash function (though perfect hashing is typically not needed)\n",
    "* One way to always have a perfect hash function is to increase hash table to be able to accomodate all possible values in item range\n",
