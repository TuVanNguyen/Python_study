    "# Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\n",

    "Output: 3\\\n",
    "Explanation: The answer is \"abc\", with the length of 3. Note that \"bca\" and \"cab\" are also correct answers.\\\n",

    "Input: s = \"bbbbb\"\\\n",

    "## Approach #1: Use a Hash Map and Sliding Window\n",
    "We can use a sliding window to track the substring we are analyzing. To implement, we'll have a variable `start` which is the starting index of the sliding window. We'll set `start` to 0 in the beginning. As we iterate over the string, the end of the sliding window will be the current `index` of the string.\n",
    "\n",
    "As we iterate over the string, we'll want to track occurences of each character in our substring. We can use a hash map `char_map` where the key is the character and the value is the last occurence of that character. `char_map` will only have characters that are in our current substring. When we encounter a character `c` that we already have in `char_map`, we'll need to splice off the beginning part of the substring ending at the last occurence of that character: `char_map[c]`. So, the new substring will have `new_start = char_map[c] + 1`. We'll also need to remove all characters before `new_start` from `char_map`, so `char_map` tracks the new substring. The substring with all the characters we'll have to remove is `remove_substring = s[start:new_start]`. After the removal, we'll want to set the new substring as our current substring: `start = new_start` and set `char_map[c] = index`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also have a variable called `longest`, which has a default value of 0. This tracks the longest substring we've seen so far. At the end of each iteration, we'll want to compare the len of our current substring to `longest` and store the bigger value. After iterating over the entire string we should end up with the longest substring length in the variable `longest`.\n",

    "* Time: O(N)\n",
    "    * We have a double nested for loop\n",
    "        * The outer loop iterates over the the entire string with length N\n",
    "        * The inner loop iterates over a substring, which is constant length C\n",
    "            * this substring must have unique characters, so worst case is that it has all the possible characters.\n",
    "            * all the ASCII characters total to 128, which we can consider a constant\n",
    "        * O(C*N) = O(N)\n",
    "* Space Complexity: O(1)\n",
    "    * we have `char_map` which stores character occurences\n",
    "        * we know that there's up to 128 ASCII characters it can store, which we can consider as a constant number"
